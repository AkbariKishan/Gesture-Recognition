# Gesture-Recognition

This project is on image sequence classification. We are provided video clips dataset in the form of RGB image sequences. We have 5 different types of gestures to be classified,
- Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
- Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
- Stop: Pause the movie
- Thumbs up: Increase the volume
- Thumbs down: Decrease the volume

Here, I have used some data pre-processing and augmentation to improve the data quality and reduce its size for computational efficiency. For model architecture, I have explored 3D-CNN and CNN-GRU.
